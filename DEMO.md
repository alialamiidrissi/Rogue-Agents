## Demo Script

**Narrator:** "Welcome to Cartoon Generator for Learning Anything! This innovative app uses AI agents to transform any educational topic into engaging cartoon comics.

Watch as I create a comic about Newton's law of gravity. The system uses a sophisticated LangGraph agent that breaks down the task into three specialized nodes: Director for planning, Asset Generator for characters, and Compositor for final assembly.

As you can see, the console shows real-time progress - first the Director analyzes the input and creates a structured script, then the Asset Generator crafts unique SVG characters, and finally the Compositor assembles everything into a beautiful HTML comic.

The result is emailed directly to the user and available for download. This makes learning fun and accessible for students of all ages!"
